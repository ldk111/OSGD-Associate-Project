# OSGD-Associate-Project

This repository contains my work for the OSGD Associate Project.

It involved analysing a large dataset from Spotify, trying to predict the popularity of songs based on their latent features and grouping songs into genres again based on these features.

This project was largely about exploring machine learning, data processing, and data analysis with the idea to apply our results to a hypothetical new artist and project their popularity.

See Associate Project Brief for more detailed description of the tasks we had to complete, Project Report for the a report of my results, and OSGD Presentation for a presentation on my findings.
